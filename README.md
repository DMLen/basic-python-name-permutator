# basic-python-name-permutator
This is a very basic name generator based on permutations. It was written for my own learning and use. It's good for naming characters and other things in a Daggerfall-esque fashion.
It is currently written for manual inputs of text files by path via terminal, but can easily be modified for function-based use in larger scripts or programs, or even to use more than two parts.

Prefixes and suffixes should each be in their own text file and delimited by commas with spaces. With the supplied prefix inputs "Da, Ma" and suffixes "vis, ley" the following names will be generated: Davis, Daley, Mavis, Maley
