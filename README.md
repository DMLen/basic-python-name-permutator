# basic-python-name-permutator
This is a very basic name generator based on permutations. It was written for my own learning and use. It's good for naming characters and other things.
It is currently written for manual inputs of text files, but can easily be modified for use in larger scripts or programs.

The generator works by combining prefixes and suffixes from to form larger words. Prefixes and suffixes should each be in their own text file and delimited by commas with spaces.
With the supplied prefix inputs "Da, Ma" and the supplied suffixes "vis, ley" the following names will be generated: Davis, Daley, Mavis, Maley
